# Automatic Hand Disinfection Dispenser

## Project Overview

The **Automatic Hand Disinfection Dispenser** project was developed during my internship at the Hanoi University of Science and Technology in Vietnam from March 2020 to May 2020. This initiative aimed to address the critical need for hand hygiene during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in educational settings.

## Team and Technology Stack

I worked in a team of three engineers, collaborating closely to design and implement the dispenser using:

- **Python**: For software development and system integration.
- **Arduino**: To control the hardware components of the dispenser.
- **Raspberry Pi**: To manage the overall system functionality and data processing.

## Key Features and Improvements

- **Automated Dispensing Mechanism**: The dispenser automatically dispenses hand sanitizer when hands are detected, minimizing contact and enhancing hygiene practices.
- **Performance Optimization**: Our efforts resulted in a **20% improvement** in system performance and a **25% increase** in system stability, ensuring reliable operation in high-traffic environments.

## Impact

By deploying this hand disinfection dispenser across **10+ Vietnamese middle schools**, we effectively contributed to reducing the transmission of COVID-19, positively impacting over **5,000 students and staff**. The project's success in promoting hygiene and safety during a critical time was a significant achievement for our team.

## Recognition

Our innovative solution received the **Gold Medal at EUROINVENT**, a prestigious international exhibition for innovative solutions. This recognition highlighted our commitment to improving educational continuity and public health through technology.

## Conclusion

The Automatic Hand Disinfection Dispenser project exemplifies the importance of innovation in public health and safety, especially in educational settings. I am proud to have contributed to a project that not only addresses immediate health concerns but also fosters a culture of hygiene among students and staff.
